# Lorenz Equations: A Study of Chaos Theory
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on Lorenz Equations and their applications in the field of Chaos Theory. This project endeavors to offer an in-depth analysis of the Lorenz equations, initially proposed by meteorologist Edward Lorenz in the 1960s. Lorenz equations play a significant role in our understanding of deterministic chaos and weather prediction models.

In this repository, you will find the source code that generates the trajectories for the Lorenz system of equations, along with a comprehensive poster that elucidates the concepts and their implications in a visually engaging manner.

Project Description
The core of the project investigates the Lorenz system of equations, formulated as follows:

```math
x' = \sigma (y-x)\\
```
```math
y' = rx - y -xz\\
```
```math
z' = xy - bz
```

where x, y, z are system variables, and \sigma, r, b are system parameters, which are usually assumed to be positive.

The project further delves into the implications of the Lorenz system, exploring topics such as the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection, non-linearities, invariance, fixed points, and the stability of the system. These mathematical phenomena are visualized using trajectories generated by the provided Python code.

A deeper understanding of these topics is vital for gaining insights into chaotic systems, a concept that fundamentally changes our understanding of predictability in seemingly random patterns in nature.

Repository Content
This repository contains:

Python scripts: Python code to generate the trajectories of the Lorenz system. By changing the parameters, you can visualize different behaviors of the Lorenz system.

Poster (in PDF format): The poster provides a graphical and succinct overview of the concepts. It discusses the Lorenz equations, their properties, global stability, and the emergence of strange attractors and chaos.

Getting Started
To run the code, clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure that you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

You can generate trajectories for the Lorenz system by running the Python scripts and manipulate the system parameters to observe their impact on the system's behavior.

Concluding Thoughts
This project offers a comprehensive exploration of the Lorenz Equations and their role in understanding chaotic behavior in deterministic systems. It is hoped that the provided resources, including the Python code and poster, prove useful in your journey into the fascinating world of Chaos Theory. Your feedback and suggestions for improving this repository are most welcome!

Enjoy exploring!
